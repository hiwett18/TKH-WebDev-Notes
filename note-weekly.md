#### 🗒️Notes from class:
- Terminal, console, shell, and command line are all different things but they are used to do the same things
- cd will take you to the home directory 
- mv will rename file names
- rm -v a.txt (uses the -v flag to list files that were deleted using the rm command.)
- rm -r removes a directory and all its contents;
